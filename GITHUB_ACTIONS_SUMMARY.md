# GitHub Actions Setup - Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Configured

Your DifyApiClient repository is now fully configured with GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD!

### 📁 Files Created

```
.github/
├── workflows/
│   ├── build-test.yml          # Continuous Integration workflow
│   └── publish-nuget.yml       # Automated NuGet publishing workflow
├── GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md     # Comprehensive setup guide
└── QUICK_START.md              # Quick reference for publishing
```

### 🔄 Workflow 1: Build and Test (CI)

**File:** `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`

**Triggers on:**
- Every push to `master`, `main`, or `develop` branches
- Every pull request to these branches

**What it does:**
- ✅ Restores NuGet dependencies
- ✅ Builds project in Release mode
- ✅ Runs all unit tests
- ✅ Generates test reports
- ✅ Creates a test package (not published)
- ✅ Uploads package as artifact (available for 7 days)

**Benefits:**
- Ensures code quality on every commit
- Catches build/test failures early
- Provides test result reports
- Validates package can be built

### 🚀 Workflow 2: Publish to NuGet (CD)

**File:** `.github/workflows/publish-nuget.yml`

**Triggers on:**
- Git tags matching pattern `v*.*.*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.2.3`)

**What it does:**
- ✅ Runs all tests (fails if any test fails)
- ✅ Extracts version from git tag
- ✅ Updates `<Version>` in `.csproj` automatically
- ✅ Builds NuGet package
- ✅ Publishes to NuGet.org
- ✅ Creates GitHub Release with:
  - Release notes
  - Package files attached
  - Installation instructions
  - Link to NuGet page

**Benefits:**
- Fully automated publishing process
- No manual steps required
- Ensures tests pass before publishing
- Creates consistent releases
- Version sync between git tag and package

### 📊 Status Badges

Added to README.md:
- **Build Status**: Shows if latest build passed/failed
- **Publish Status**: Shows if latest publish succeeded
- **NuGet Version**: Shows current version on NuGet.org
- **License**: Shows MIT license

## 🔐 Required Setup (One-Time)

### **IMPORTANT: Add NuGet API Key to GitHub**

You must complete this step before the publish workflow can work:

1. **Get NuGet API Key:**
   - Visit: https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys
   - Click "Create"
   - Name: `GitHub Actions - DifyApiClient`
   - Expiration: 365 days
   - Scopes: "Push new packages and package versions"
   - Glob Pattern: `DifyApiClient*`
   - Click "Create" and **copy the key**

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/HK-Zhang/DifyApiClient/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `NUGET_API_KEY`
   - Value: Paste your NuGet API key
   - Click "Add secret"

**⚠️ Without this secret, the publish workflow will fail!**

## 🎯 How to Use

### Publishing a New Version

**Simple 3-step process:**

```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md and commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin master

# 2. Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# 3. That's it! GitHub Actions handles the rest
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. Workflow starts within seconds
2. Runs all tests
3. Builds package
4. Publishes to NuGet.org
5. Creates GitHub Release
6. Package appears on NuGet in 5-15 minutes

### Monitoring

- **View workflows:** https://github.com/HK-Zhang/DifyApiClient/actions
- **Email notifications:** Enabled by default for failures
- **Status badges:** Visible in README.md

### For Subsequent Releases

```bash
# Update version and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Release v1.0.1"
git push origin master

# Tag and push
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

| Feature | Build & Test | Publish to NuGet |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| **Trigger** | Every push/PR | Version tags only |
| **Runs Tests** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Builds Package** | ✅ Yes (test) | ✅ Yes |
| **Publishes** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Creates Release** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Frequency** | Very frequent | On-demand |

## 📋 Pre-Release Checklist

Before pushing a version tag:

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Update version in documentation if needed
- [ ] All tests pass locally: `dotnet test`
- [ ] Build succeeds locally: `dotnet build -c Release`
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to master
- [ ] NuGet API key secret is configured in GitHub

Then:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Add More Branches to CI

Edit `.github/workflows/build-test.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, main, develop, feature/* ]
```

### Add Pre-release Support

For beta/alpha versions, create tags like:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0-beta.1
git push origin v1.0.0-beta.1
```

The workflow will automatically publish as pre-release.

### Add Code Coverage

You can extend the workflow to generate code coverage reports and upload to Codecov or similar services.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "401 Unauthorized" Error

**Problem:** NuGet API key is not set or invalid

**Solution:**
1. Verify secret is named exactly `NUGET_API_KEY`
2. Check API key hasn't expired
3. Regenerate key if needed

### "Package already exists"

**Problem:** Version already published to NuGet

**Solution:**
- Increment version number
- Create new tag
- You cannot overwrite published versions

### Workflow Not Triggering

**Problem:** Tag doesn't match pattern

**Solution:**
- Use format: `v1.0.0` (with lowercase 'v' prefix)
- Ensure tag was pushed: `git push origin v1.0.0`

### Tests Fail in CI

**Problem:** Tests pass locally but fail in CI

**Solution:**
- Check workflow logs for details
- May be environment-specific issues
- Fix tests and push again (no need to recreate tag if not published yet)
